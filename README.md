# Gather
A cohousing meals management system.

## Platform
Gather is a Ruby on Rails application with some client-side JavaScript for dynamic view elements. HTML is generally rendered server-side. [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/) is used for styling. No special IDE is required for Ruby on Rails development.

Ruby on Rails applications are best developed and run on Linux, Unix, or Mac OS. Development is also possible, though not recommended, on Windows. See the [Rails download page](http://rubyonrails.org/download/) for more information.

## System dependencies

To install the software below we recommend the following package managers:

- Mac OS X: [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)
- Linux/Unix: bundled package manager (e.g. apt-get, yum)

For all environments:

1. Ruby (see [.ruby-version file](.ruby-version) for exact version, [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) is recommended for Ruby version management)
1. [Bundler](http://bundler.io/)
    1. Once Ruby is installed, run `gem install bundler` to install.
1. PostgreSQL v9.2+ (database)
1. ImageMagick v6.8+
1. Mailcatcher for testing email (run `gem install mailcatcher` to install).
    1. Note, this gem is deliberately not in the Gemfile because it is a standalone development tool.
1. A Gather OAuth client via the [Google API Console](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849?hl=en).

For development environments:

1. PhantomJS v2.1+

## Development Setup Guide
Follow these steps to setup a development environment for Gather.

1. Install all above dependencies

1. Retrieve project files using Git
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/sassafrastech/gather.git
    cd gather
    ```

    If developing, it's best to work off the development branch:
    ```
    git checkout develop
    ```

    The remaining steps should all be done from the project directory.

1. Install gems
    1. Run `bundle install` to install the required gems.

1. Set local config
    1. Copy `config/settings.local.yml.example` to `config/settings.local.yml`.
    1. Edit `config/settings.local.yml` to fit your environment.

1. Create development and test databases and schemas
    1. Copy `config/database.yml.example` to `config/database.yml`.
    1. Run `rake db:create` to create `gather_development` and `gather_test` databases.
    1. Run `rake db:schema:load` to create the schema in both databases.

1. Create some fake data and a user so you can sign in
    1. Run `rake fake:data` to add one cluster, one community, and a full complement of fake data. This command will also add a user with superadmin privileges with the Gmail address you entered in `settings.local.yml`.

1. Run the tests
    1. Run `bundle exec rspec`.
    1. All tests should pass.

1. Start the server
    1. Run `bundle exec rails s`.
    1. Leave this console open.

1. Start DelayedJob
    1. Open a new console.
    1. Go to the project directory.
    1. Run `bin/delayed_job start`.

1. Start using the system
    1. In a browser, go to `http://gather.localhost.tv:3000` to start Gather.
    1. Click "Sign in with Google" to use Gather as the user you just created.
    1. Enjoy!
