  guidelines: "# Kitchen Guidelines\n\n## Overview\n\nThe common house (CH) kitchen
    is a large investment on the part of our community and also has the potential
    to be a dangerous area of the CH. Since our priority is the safety of all members
    of our community, as well as our equipment, we have the following guidelines.\n
    \nWe expect every community member and their guests to treat this equipment and
    this facility with care and respect.\n \nParents are responsible for educating
    their children that:\n\n* The kitchen is not a play area.\n* The food in the kitchen
    is not for general consumption unless otherwise labeled.\n* Children may only
    be in the kitchen if they are specifically invited in and will be supervised by
    an adult taking responsibility.\n \n*Please leave the kitchen cleaner than you
    found it.*\n\nAnd letâ€™s have fun, and make and eat delicious food together!\n\n##
    Safety Considerations\n\n* If you leave the kitchen while something is cooking
    in the oven or on a burner, please take precautions to warn others by placing
    a barrier in the entrances to the kitchen and leaving a note.\n* Leave pots with
    hot stuff on back, not front burners.\n* Do not move the baking soda away from
    the stove; it is there in case of fire.  \n* Sharp knives should never be left
    unattended nor placed in sudsy water.\n\nIf you have to leave before completely
    cleaning up, please leave a message about when you will return (with your phone
    number).  \n\nPlease sign out any borrowed items and return them as soon as you
    can.\n  \nPlease report anything odd, such as strange noises, smells, or broken
    items, to designated repair person.\n \nThe CH refrigerator is to be used for
    staples and community meals. Please distribute leftovers rather than store them
    here.\n\nSee separate doc for job responsibilities for head cook, assistant cooks
    and cleaners.\n\n## Basic Sanitation Rules\n \n1. If you might be sick, keep the
    community healthy by going home.\n1. Wash your hands often, the old fashioned
    way: with soap and hot water.\n1. Completely cover all cuts; no blood!\n1. When
    tasting, please use spoons only once.\n1. Avoid cross-contamination (allergens/bacteria)
    by using different utensils for different items.\n1. Everything that touches raw
    meat should not be used for anything else until thoroughly washed and sanitized.
    \n1. Use the appropriately colored cutting board for different food categories.\n1.
    Be aware that sinks can harbor bacteria; colanders are recommended for cleaning
    produce that will be served raw.\n1. Foods stay safe when they are thoroughly
    chilled or thoroughly heated.  Details can be found at (link).\n\n## Staples Guidelines\n\nStaples
    will be bought with the intention of being used for CH meals.   \n \nWhen buying
    staples, we will take into consideration the following factors: non-GMO, organic,
    fair trade/labor practices, dietary preference, shelf life and affordability.\n
    \nStaples will be paid for via a surcharge on CH meals, which will be used to
    buy new inventory.  Head cooks are expected to use the staples to rotate inventory
    and to keep their meal costs down.\n\nTherefore, please refrain from using staples
    for personal use. If absolutely necessary: \n \n* Replace item for item.\n* If
    this is not possible, please generously contribute to the kitchen staples fund.\n
    \nIf you notice that we are running low on an item, please write it on the clipboard
    designated for this purpose.\n\nKitchen coordinator is responsible for checking
    the list and the pantry weekly and shopping as needed. Every effort will be made
    to replace staples as we run out.\n \nIf you need a staple item to cook for an
    official meal and notice it is not there, please buy it for us and submit a separate
    receipt for reimbursement.\n \nA specific list of staples will be maintained by
    the meals committee.\n\nOther items, including bottled salad dressings, need to
    be bought by head cooks."
