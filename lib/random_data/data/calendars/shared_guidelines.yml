  body: "# Common House Guidelines\r\r* Welcome to Touchstone and our Common House!\r*
    Our Common House is the center of our community life.\r* Relationships are key
    at Touchstone.\r* Every community member has an equal right to be heard in how
    we use our Common House.\r* We treat the CH as respectfully as we would treat
    a neighbor’s house. Please leave the Common House the way you found it...or better!\r\rThe
    following are guidelines that balance freedom, responsibility and safety for people
    and the building.\r\r## Accessibility\r\rIn order to accommodate sensitivities,
    we agree to the following:\r\r* *Fragrance free* is the goal in the CH (see existing
    TS fragrance free policy).\r* *Smoking* As an extension of the no smoking policy
    in the common element of Touchstone, there is no smoking in the Common House.\r*
    *Animals* The Common House is pet free, with the exception of service animals.
    Pets are not to be left unattended on the Common House grounds.\r\r## Security\r\rThe
    CH will be secured each weeknight by 10:00PM, Friday and Saturday by 11:00PM,
    using CH Closing Procedure Checklist.\r\r## Communication\r\rAll residents will
    address concerns directly whenever possible. If necessary, the CH and Peacekeeping
    committees are available for support and help.\r\r## Maintenance\r\rBroken or
    improperly operating systems or appliances will be reported immediately to Maintenance
    Committee at maintenance@touchstonecohousing.org.\r\rFor more routine matters,
    send email or place note in Maintenance Folder.\r\rReport broken items to the
    Common House Committee ch@touchstonecohousing.org.\r\r## Alcohol\r\rNeither alcohol,
    open or sealed, nor any medications, are to be left or stored in the Common House.\r\r##
    Noise Level\r\rThose affected by noise inside the CH are invited to request a
    lower noise level. Please be considerate of others who ask for a lower noise level.\r\rThe
    community will be notified if a large event is planned that may exceed normal
    noise levels or go past closing time.\r\r## Quiet Hours\r\r* Weekdays 10:00PM
    to 8:00AM\r* Weekends and holidays 11:00PM to 9:00AM\r\r## The Common House is
    for Touchstone residents and their invited guests\r\r* We recognize the past support
    and hospitality of both Sunward and Great Oak cohousing communities.\r* As we
    welcome our cohousing neighbors, we expect that any problems will be dealt with
    in a fair and mutually beneficial manner, based on reciprocity and trust.\r* As
    we build this shared understanding with other neighboring communities, we may
    enter into such reciprocal relationships with them as well.\r\rThe Common House
    will be open to members of both the neighboring cohousing communities. The procedures
    for reserving rooms will be followed See children’s guidelines.\r\rAnyone else
    entering the Common House should be hosted by a Touchstone adult, who will be
    responsible for the behavior or his/her guests.\r\r## Reserving Rooms\r\rThere
    will be a system to facilitate the event process once the new computer system
    is in place.\r\rOfficial TS community activities will be placed on the calendar
    and will take precedence over other events.\r\rAll guidelines are to be
    approved by the consensus process.\r\rAll residents’ input is welcome as we begin
    to inhabit the Common House and continue to refine these guidelines. We will formally
    revisit them in early 2016."
