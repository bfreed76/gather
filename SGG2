Notes on changing unit_num to unit_num_and_suffix:

./policies/household_policy.rb:    permitted.concat([:unit_num, :old_id, :old_n
ame]) if administer?
Look this up.

./models/household.rb:
* Should be done; check

./models/user.rb:  scope :by_unit, -> { joins(:household).order("households.unit_num") }
./models/user.rb:  delegate :community_id, :community_name, :community_abbrv, :cluster, :unit_num, :vehicles, to: :household
* Take a look at these

./models/people/exporter.rb:    COLUMNS = %w(first_name last_name unit_num birthdate email child
* probably change

./models/utils/fake_data/people_generator.rb:            unit_num: i + 1,
./decorators/csv/user_decorator.rb:    def unit_num
./decorators/user_decorator.rb:  def unit_num_with_hash
* what are decorators for?

./views/users/_printable_album.html.erb:              <div class="unit-num"><%= user.unit_num_with_hash %></div>
./views/households/_fields.html.erb:<%= f.input :unit_num, as: :string, disabled: !policy(f.object).administer? %>
./views/households/_unit_community.html.erb:  <td><%= household.unit_num.nil? ? "[None]" : "##{household.unit_num}" %></td>
./views/households/index.html.erb:          <%= household.unit_num.present? ? household.unit_num : "" %>
