          Click **Edit** above to see how this page works! And don't worry, you can't break anything!

          ## Formatting

          To edit a Wiki page, you use **Markdown**, which is a simple way of creating clean, nice-looking content without needing to learn a special language. To learn more about Markdown, see the [Markdown Formatting Guide](/about/markdown).

          ## Links

          Links to other pages are very important! You can link to other **wiki pages** like this: [[Fun Page]].

          Note that the above link is (probably) red. That's because the page doesn't exist yet. If you click the link, you will have a chance to create the page. The link will then become blue!

          If you want to use something other than the page's title as the link text, you can [[Fun Page|do this]].

          Links to external pages look [like this](http://example.com).

          A URL in plain text will be automatically recognized and converted to a link: https://gather.coop
