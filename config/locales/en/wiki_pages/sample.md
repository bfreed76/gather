This is a sample wiki page.

To edit a Wiki page, you use **Markdown**, which is a simple way of creating clean, nice-looking content without needing to learn a special language. To learn more about Markdown, see the [Markdown Formatting Guide](/about/markdown).

Click **Edit** above to see how this page works! And don't worry, you can't break anything!

## Links

Links to other pages are very important! You can link to other **wiki pages** like this: [[Fun Page]].

Note that the above link is (probably) red. That's because the page doesn't exist yet. If you click the link, you will have a chance to create the page. The link will then become blue!

Links to external pages look [like this](http://example.com).

Plain link text will be automatically recognized: https://gather.coop

## Images

You can display images from the web like this:

![Gather Logo](https://gather.coop/wiki-sample-img.svg)

In future releases you will be able to attach images to wiki pages also. Stay tuned!
