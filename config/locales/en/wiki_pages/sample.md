## Links

Links to other pages are very important! You can link to other **wiki pages** like this: [[Fun Page]].

Note that the above link is (probably) red. That's because the page doesn't exist yet. If you click the link, you will have a chance to create the page. The link will then become blue!

Links to external pages look [like this](http://example.com).

Plain link text will be automatically recognized: https://gather.coop

## Images

You can display images from the web like this:

![Gather Logo](https://gather.coop/wiki-sample-img.svg)

In future releases you will be able to attach images to wiki pages also. Stay tuned!

## Horizontal Rules

You might use one of these to divide your content:

---

nice!

## Raw HTML

If you are an advanced user and want to use raw HTML, try it out!

For instance, <del>you might want to use strikethrough</del>.

Now have fun creating lots of useful wiki content!
