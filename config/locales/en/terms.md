## Agreement between User and https://gather.coop

Welcome to https://gather.coop. The https://gather.coop website (the "Site") is comprised of various web pages operated by CommunitySoft, LLC ("CommunitySoft"). https://gather.coop is offered to you (the "User") conditioned on your acceptance without modification of the terms, conditions, and notices contained herein (the "Terms"). Your use of https://gather.coop constitutes your agreement to all such Terms. Please read these terms carefully, and keep a copy of them for your reference.

https://gather.coop is a community management Site. Its mission is to make the administration of communities easier so members can focus on having fun and building relationships. The Site is divided into "Clusters", each of which is comprised of one or more "Communities". Each User belongs to exactly one Community and Cluster. Users may only access information within their own Cluster, except for a very small number of CommunitySoft workers with "Super Admin" privileges, who can access all Clusters.

## Privacy

Your use of https://gather.coop is subject to CommunitySoft's [Privacy Policy](/about/privacy-policy). Please review our Privacy Policy, which also governs the Site and informs Users of our data collection practices.

## Electronic Communications

Visiting https://gather.coop or sending emails to CommunitySoft constitutes electronic communications. You consent to receive electronic communications and you agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures and other communications that we provide to you electronically, via email and on the Site, satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing.

## Your Account

If you use this Site, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password and for restricting access to your computer, and you agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or password, except those that are performed by a User with "Admin", "Cluster Admin", or "Super Admin" privileges using the "Impersonate" function, which is provided for support and assistance purposes only. You may not assign or otherwise transfer your account to any other person or entity. You acknowledge that CommunitySoft is not responsible for third party access to your account that results from theft or misappropriation of your account. CommunitySoft and its associates reserve the right to refuse or cancel service, terminate accounts, or remove or edit content in our sole discretion.

## Children Under Thirteen

CommunitySoft collects personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen. CommunitySoft collects this information for the following reason(s):

* To facilitate interpersonal relationships by allowing community members to learn the names and faces of community children
* To enable looking up of useful information such as birthdays and emergency medical information

The Site differentiates between adult (full) Users and children. Users classified as children are not permitted to sign into or use the Site but appear in the directory and may receive email notifications. There is no lower or upper age limit upon who may be classified as a full User. If you are under the age of thirteen and classified as a full User, you must ask your parent or guardian for permission to use this website. If you are a parent and you have questions regarding our data collection practices, please contact us using the information provided at the end of this Agreement. If you are under 18, you may use https://gather.coop only with permission of a parent or guardian.

## Trial Period, Cancellation, Refund Policy

New Communities are offered a trial period at no charge when first joining the Site. After this trial period has expired, a subscription fee will be charged on a monthly or yearly basis. Once subscribed, you may choose not to renew your subscription at any time. In this case, once the time paid for has expired, your community will be deactivated. There are no refunds.
